# HeatMapsCapstoneRepo
### Repository for S&amp;DS 425 Capstone Project

Everything you need to replicate the results of this project exists in this GitHub repository. Just follow the instructions outlined in the report. 

### Make sure you have an `.Rproj` object in your local folder! 
### The `.Rdata` files `data/dirty_heatmaps_3_1.Rdata`, `data/dirty_heatmaps_5_1.Rdata`, and `data/dirty_heatmaps_10_1.Rdata` are all larger than 100MB, so they must be downloaded using Git LFS. Downloading this entire repo as a `.zip` file consequently does not work! Either download the repository as a `.zip` file, unzip, and then download each of the files above individually, or clone the repository, and move the resulting file wherever you desire in your local machine.

Please reach out if you have any questions!

Note: `HeatMaps` is the folder you should download to run the R Shiny app accompanying this project locally! Highly recommend!
